<h2 class="chapter">7 Server Configuration</h2>
<a name="index-initialization"></a>
<p>The commands here are commonly found in the openocd.cfg file and are
used to specify what TCP/IP ports are used, and how GDB should be
supported.
</p>
<a name="configurationstage"></a><a name="Configuration-Stage"></a>
<h3 class="section">7.1 Configuration Stage</h3>
<a name="index-configuration-stage"></a>
<a name="index-config-command"></a>

<p>When the OpenOCD server process starts up, it enters a
<em>configuration stage</em> which is the only time that
certain commands, <em>configuration commands</em>, may be issued.
Normally, configuration commands are only available
inside startup scripts.
</p>
<p>In this manual, the definition of a configuration command is
presented as a <em>Config Command</em>, not as a <em>Command</em>
which may be issued interactively.
The runtime <code>help</code> command also highlights configuration
commands, and those which may be issued at any time.
</p>
<p>Those configuration commands include declaration of TAPs,
flash banks,
the interface used for JTAG communication,
and other basic setup.
The server must leave the configuration stage before it
may access or activate TAPs.
After it leaves this stage, configuration commands may no
longer be issued.
</p>
<a name="enteringtherunstage"></a><a name="Entering-the-Run-Stage"></a>
<h3 class="section">7.2 Entering the Run Stage</h3>

<p>The first thing OpenOCD does after leaving the configuration
stage is to verify that it can talk to the scan chain
(list of TAPs) which has been configured.
It will warn if it doesn&rsquo;t find TAPs it expects to find,
or finds TAPs that aren&rsquo;t supposed to be there.
You should see no errors at this point.
If you see errors, resolve them by correcting the
commands you used to configure the server.
Common errors include using an initial JTAG speed that&rsquo;s too
fast, and not providing the right IDCODE values for the TAPs
on the scan chain.
</p>
<p>Once OpenOCD has entered the run stage, a number of commands
become available.
A number of these relate to the debug targets you may have declared.
For example, the <code>mww</code> command will not be available until
a target has been successfuly instantiated.
If you want to use those commands, you may need to force
entry to the run stage.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-init"></a>Config Command: <strong>init</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This command terminates the configuration stage and
enters the run stage. This helps when you need to have
the startup scripts manage tasks such as resetting the target,
programming flash, etc. To reset the CPU upon startup, add &quot;init&quot; and
&quot;reset&quot; at the end of the config script or at the end of the OpenOCD
command line using the <samp>-c</samp> command line switch.
</p>
<p>If this command does not appear in any startup/configuration file
OpenOCD executes the command for you after processing all
configuration files and/or command line options.
</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> This command normally occurs at or near the end of your
openocd.cfg file to force OpenOCD to &ldquo;initialize&rdquo; and make the
targets ready. For example: If your openocd.cfg file needs to
read/write memory on your target, <code>init</code> must occur before
the memory read/write commands. This includes <code>nand probe</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-jtag_005finit"></a>Overridable Procedure: <strong>jtag_init</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is invoked at server startup to verify that it can talk
to the scan chain (list of TAPs) which has been configured.
</p>
<p>The default implementation first tries <code>jtag arp_init</code>,
which uses only a lightweight JTAG reset before examining the
scan chain.
If that fails, it tries again, using a harder reset
from the overridable procedure <code>init_reset</code>.
</p>
<p>Implementations must have verified the JTAG scan chain before
they return.
This is done by calling <code>jtag arp_init</code>
(or <code>jtag arp_init-reset</code>).
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="tcpipports"></a><a name="TCP_002fIP-Ports"></a>
<h3 class="section">7.3 TCP/IP Ports</h3>
<a name="index-TCP-port"></a>
<a name="index-server"></a>
<a name="index-port"></a>
<a name="index-security"></a>
<p>The OpenOCD server accepts remote commands in several syntaxes.
Each syntax uses a different TCP/IP port, which you may specify
only during configuration (before those ports are opened).
</p>
<p>For reasons including security, you may wish to prevent remote
access using one or more of these ports.
In such cases, just specify the relevant port number as &quot;disabled&quot;.
If you disable all access through TCP/IP, you will need to
use the command line <samp>-pipe</samp> option.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gdb_005fport"></a>Command: <strong>gdb_port</strong> <em>[number]</em></dt>
<dd><a name="index-GDB-server"></a>
<p>Normally gdb listens to a TCP/IP port, but GDB can also
communicate via pipes(stdin/out or named pipes). The name
&quot;gdb_port&quot; stuck because it covers probably more than 90% of
the normal use cases.
</p>
<p>No arguments reports GDB port. &quot;pipe&quot; means listen to stdin
output to stdout, an integer is base port number, &quot;disabled&quot;
disables the gdb server.
</p>
<p>When using &quot;pipe&quot;, also use log_output to redirect the log
output to a file so as not to flood the stdin/out pipes.
</p>
<p>The -p/&ndash;pipe option is deprecated and a warning is printed
as it is equivalent to passing in -c &quot;gdb_port pipe; log_output openocd.log&quot;.
</p>
<p>Any other string is interpreted as named pipe to listen to.
Output pipe is the same name as input pipe, but with &rsquo;o&rsquo; appended,
e.g. /var/gdb, /var/gdbo.
</p>
<p>The GDB port for the first target will be the base port, the
second target will listen on gdb_port + 1, and so on.
When not specified during the configuration stage,
the port <var>number</var> defaults to 3333.
</p>
<p>Note: when using &quot;gdb_port pipe&quot;, increasing the default remote timeout in
gdb (with &rsquo;set remotetimeout&rsquo;) is recommended. An insufficient timeout may
cause initialization to fail with &quot;Unknown remote qXfer reply: OK&quot;.
</p>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-tcl_005fport"></a>Command: <strong>tcl_port</strong> <em>[number]</em></dt>
<dd><p>Specify or query the port used for a simplified RPC
connection that can be used by clients to issue TCL commands and get the
output from the Tcl engine.
Intended as a machine interface.
When not specified during the configuration stage,
the port <var>number</var> defaults to 6666.
When specified as &quot;disabled&quot;, this service is not activated.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-telnet_005fport"></a>Command: <strong>telnet_port</strong> <em>[number]</em></dt>
<dd><p>Specify or query the
port on which to listen for incoming telnet connections.
This port is intended for interaction with one human through TCL commands.
When not specified during the configuration stage,
the port <var>number</var> defaults to 4444.
When specified as &quot;disabled&quot;, this service is not activated.
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="gdbconfiguration"></a><a name="GDB-Configuration"></a>
<h3 class="section">7.4 GDB Configuration</h3>
<a name="index-GDB"></a>
<a name="index-GDB-configuration"></a>
<p>You can reconfigure some GDB behaviors if needed.
The ones listed here are static and global.
See <a href="CPU-Configuration.html#targetconfiguration">Target Configuration</a>, about configuring individual targets.
See <a href="CPU-Configuration.html#targetevents">Target Events</a>, about configuring target-specific event handling.
</p>
<a name="gdbbreakpointoverride"></a><dl>
<dt><a name="index-gdb_005fbreakpoint_005foverride"></a>Command: <strong>gdb_breakpoint_override</strong> <em>[<samp>hard</samp>|<samp>soft</samp>|<samp>disable</samp>]</em></dt>
<dd><p>Force breakpoint type for gdb <code>break</code> commands.
This option supports GDB GUIs which don&rsquo;t
distinguish hard versus soft breakpoints, if the default OpenOCD and
GDB behaviour is not sufficient. GDB normally uses hardware
breakpoints if the memory map has been set up for flash regions.
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="gdbflashprogram"></a><dl>
<dt><a name="index-gdb_005fflash_005fprogram"></a>Config Command: <strong>gdb_flash_program</strong> <em>(<samp>enable</samp>|<samp>disable</samp>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Set to <samp>enable</samp> to cause OpenOCD to program the flash memory when a
vFlash packet is received.
The default behaviour is <samp>enable</samp>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gdb_005fmemory_005fmap"></a>Config Command: <strong>gdb_memory_map</strong> <em>(<samp>enable</samp>|<samp>disable</samp>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Set to <samp>enable</samp> to cause OpenOCD to send the memory configuration to GDB when
requested. GDB will then know when to set hardware breakpoints, and program flash
using the GDB load command. <code>gdb_flash_program enable</code> must also be enabled
for flash programming to work.
Default behaviour is <samp>enable</samp>.
See <a href="#gdbflashprogram">gdb_flash_program</a>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gdb_005freport_005fdata_005fabort"></a>Config Command: <strong>gdb_report_data_abort</strong> <em>(<samp>enable</samp>|<samp>disable</samp>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies whether data aborts cause an error to be reported
by GDB memory read packets.
The default behaviour is <samp>disable</samp>;
use <samp>enable</samp> see these errors reported.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gdb_005ftarget_005fdescription"></a>Config Command: <strong>gdb_target_description</strong> <em>(<samp>enable</samp>|<samp>disable</samp>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Set to <samp>enable</samp> to cause OpenOCD to send the target descriptions to gdb via qXfer:features:read packet.
The default behaviour is <samp>enable</samp>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gdb_005fsave_005ftdesc"></a>Command: <strong>gdb_save_tdesc</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Saves the target descripton file to the local file system.
</p>
<p>The file name is <i>target_name</i>.xml.
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="eventpolling"></a><a name="Event-Polling"></a>
<h3 class="section">7.5 Event Polling</h3>

<p>Hardware debuggers are parts of asynchronous systems,
where significant events can happen at any time.
The OpenOCD server needs to detect some of these events,
so it can report them to through TCL command line
or to GDB.
</p>
<p>Examples of such events include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> One of the targets can stop running ... maybe it triggers
a code breakpoint or data watchpoint, or halts itself.
</li><li> Messages may be sent over &ldquo;debug message&rdquo; channels ... many
targets support such messages sent over JTAG,
for receipt by the person debugging or tools.
</li><li> Loss of power ... some adapters can detect these events.
</li><li> Resets not issued through JTAG ... such reset sources
can include button presses or other system hardware, sometimes
including the target itself (perhaps through a watchdog).
</li><li> Debug instrumentation sometimes supports event triggering
such as &ldquo;trace buffer full&rdquo; (so it can quickly be emptied)
or other signals (to correlate with code behavior).
</li></ul>

<p>None of those events are signaled through standard JTAG signals.
However, most conventions for JTAG connectors include voltage
level and system reset (SRST) signal detection.
Some connectors also include instrumentation signals, which
can imply events when those signals are inputs.
</p>
<p>In general, OpenOCD needs to periodically check for those events,
either by looking at the status of signals on the JTAG connector
or by sending synchronous &ldquo;tell me your status&rdquo; JTAG requests
to the various active targets.
There is a command to manage and monitor that polling,
which is normally done in the background.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-poll"></a>Command: <strong>poll</strong> <em>[<samp>on</samp>|<samp>off</samp>]</em></dt>
<dd><p>Poll the current target for its current state.
(Also, see <a href="CPU-Configuration.html#targetcurstate">target curstate</a>.)
If that target is in debug mode, architecture
specific information about the current state is printed.
An optional parameter
allows background polling to be enabled and disabled.
</p>
<p>You could use this from the TCL command shell, or
from GDB using <code>monitor poll</code> command.
Leave background polling enabled while you&rsquo;re using GDB.
</p><div class="example">
