<h2 class="chapter">10 TAP Declaration</h2>
<a name="index-TAP-declaration"></a>
<a name="index-TAP-configuration"></a>

<p><em>Test Access Ports</em> (TAPs) are the core of JTAG.
TAPs serve many roles, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Debug Target</b> A CPU TAP can be used as a GDB debug target.
</li><li> <b>Flash Programming</b> Some chips program the flash directly via JTAG.
Others do it indirectly, making a CPU do it.
</li><li> <b>Program Download</b> Using the same CPU support GDB uses,
you can initialize a DRAM controller, download code to DRAM, and then
start running that code.
</li><li> <b>Boundary Scan</b> Most chips support boundary scan, which
helps test for board assembly problems like solder bridges
and missing connections.
</li></ul>

<p>OpenOCD must know about the active TAPs on your board(s).
Setting up the TAPs is the core task of your configuration files.
Once those TAPs are set up, you can pass their names to code
which sets up CPUs and exports them as GDB targets,
probes flash memory, performs low-level JTAG operations, and more.
</p>
<a name="Scan-Chains"></a>
<h3 class="section">10.1 Scan Chains</h3>
<a name="index-scan-chain"></a>

<p>TAPs are part of a hardware <em>scan chain</em>,
which is a daisy chain of TAPs.
They also need to be added to
OpenOCD&rsquo;s software mirror of that hardware list,
giving each member a name and associating other data with it.
Simple scan chains, with a single TAP, are common in
systems with a single microcontroller or microprocessor.
More complex chips may have several TAPs internally.
Very complex scan chains might have a dozen or more TAPs:
several in one chip, more in the next, and connecting
to other boards with their own chips and TAPs.
</p>
<p>You can display the list with the <code>scan_chain</code> command.
(Don&rsquo;t confuse this with the list displayed by the <code>targets</code>
command, presented in the next chapter.
That only displays TAPs for CPUs which are configured as
debugging targets.)
Here&rsquo;s what the scan chain might look like for a chip more than one TAP:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">   TapName            Enabled IdCode     Expected   IrLen IrCap IrMask
-- ------------------ ------- ---------- ---------- ----- ----- ------
 0 omap5912.dsp          Y    0x03df1d81 0x03df1d81    38 0x01  0x03
 1 omap5912.arm          Y    0x0692602f 0x0692602f     4 0x01  0x0f
 2 omap5912.unknown      Y    0x00000000 0x00000000     8 0x01  0x03
</pre>
<p>OpenOCD can detect some of that information, but not all
of it. See <a href="#autoprobing">Autoprobing</a>.
Unfortunately, those TAPs can&rsquo;t always be autoconfigured,
because not all devices provide good support for that.
JTAG doesn&rsquo;t require supporting IDCODE instructions, and
chips with JTAG routers may not link TAPs into the chain
until they are told to do so.
</p>
<p>The configuration mechanism currently supported by OpenOCD
requires explicit configuration of all TAP devices using
<code>jtag newtap</code> commands, as detailed later in this chapter.
A command like this would declare one tap and name it <code>chip1.cpu</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">jtag newtap chip1 cpu -irlen 4 -expected-id 0x3ba00477
</pre></div>

<p>Each target configuration file lists the TAPs provided
by a given chip.
Board configuration files combine all the targets on a board,
and so forth.
Note that <em>the order in which TAPs are declared is very important.</em>
That declaration order must match the order in the JTAG scan chain,
both inside a single chip and between them.
See <a href="FAQ.html#faqtaporder">FAQ TAP Order</a>.
</p>
<p>For example, the ST Microsystems STR912 chip has
three separate TAPs<a name="DOCF5" href="#FOOT5"><sup>5</sup></a>.
To configure those taps, <samp>target/str912.cfg</samp>
includes commands something like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">jtag newtap str912 flash ... params ...
jtag newtap str912 cpu ... params ...
jtag newtap str912 bs ... params ...
</pre></div>

<p>Actual config files typically use a variable such as <code>$_CHIPNAME</code>
instead of literals like <samp>str912</samp>, to support more than one chip
of each type.  See <a href="Config-File-Guidelines.html#Config-File-Guidelines">Config File Guidelines</a>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-jtag-names"></a>Command: <strong>jtag names</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the names of all current TAPs in the scan chain.
Use <code>jtag cget</code> or <code>jtag tapisenabled</code>
to examine attributes and state of each TAP.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">foreach t [jtag names] {
    puts [format &quot;TAP: %s\n&quot; $t]
}
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-scan_005fchain"></a>Command: <strong>scan_chain</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Displays the TAPs in the scan chain configuration,
and their status.
The set of TAPs listed by this command is fixed by
exiting the OpenOCD configuration stage,
but systems with a JTAG router can
enable or disable TAPs dynamically.
</p></dd></dl>



<a name="TAP-Names"></a>
<h3 class="section">10.2 TAP Names</h3>
<a name="index-dotted-name"></a>

<p>When TAP objects are declared with <code>jtag newtap</code>,
a <em>dotted.name</em> is created for the TAP, combining the
name of a module (usually a chip) and a label for the TAP.
For example: <code>xilinx.tap</code>, <code>str912.flash</code>,
<code>omap3530.jrc</code>, <code>dm6446.dsp</code>, or <code>stm32.cpu</code>.
Many other commands use that dotted.name to manipulate or
refer to the TAP. For example, CPU configuration uses the
name, as does declaration of NAND or NOR flash banks.
</p>
<p>The components of a dotted name should follow &ldquo;C&rdquo; symbol
name rules: start with an alphabetic character, then numbers
and underscores are OK; while others (including dots!) are not.
</p>
<a name="TAP-Declaration-Commands"></a>
<h3 class="section">10.3 TAP Declaration Commands</h3>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-jtag-newtap"></a>Command: <strong>jtag newtap</strong> <em>chipname tapname configparams...</em></dt>
<dd><p>Declares a new TAP with the dotted name <var>chipname</var>.<var>tapname</var>,
and configured according to the various <var>configparams</var>.
</p>
<p>The <var>chipname</var> is a symbolic name for the chip.
Conventionally target config files use <code>$_CHIPNAME</code>,
defaulting to the model name given by the chip vendor but
overridable.
</p>
<a name="index-TAP-naming-convention"></a>
<p>The <var>tapname</var> reflects the role of that TAP,
and should follow this convention:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>bs</code> &ndash; For boundary scan if this is a separate TAP;
</li><li> <code>cpu</code> &ndash; The main CPU of the chip, alternatively
<code>arm</code> and <code>dsp</code> on chips with both ARM and DSP CPUs,
<code>arm1</code> and <code>arm2</code> on chips with two ARMs, and so forth;
</li><li> <code>etb</code> &ndash; For an embedded trace buffer (example: an ARM ETB11);
</li><li> <code>flash</code> &ndash; If the chip has a flash TAP, like the str912;
</li><li> <code>jrc</code> &ndash; For JTAG route controller (example: the ICEPick modules
on many Texas Instruments chips, like the OMAP3530 on Beagleboards);
</li><li> <code>tap</code> &ndash; Should be used only for FPGA- or CPLD-like devices
with a single TAP;
</li><li> <code>unknownN</code> &ndash; If you have no idea what the TAP is for (N is a number);
</li><li> <em>when in doubt</em> &ndash; Use the chip maker&rsquo;s name in their data sheet.
For example, the Freescale i.MX31 has a SDMA (Smart DMA) with
a JTAG TAP; that TAP should be named <code>sdma</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>Every TAP requires at least the following <var>configparams</var>:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>-irlen</code> <var>NUMBER</var>
<br>The length in bits of the
instruction register, such as 4 or 5 bits.
</li></ul>

<p>A TAP may also provide optional <var>configparams</var>:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>-disable</code> (or <code>-enable</code>)
<br>Use the <code>-disable</code> parameter to flag a TAP which is not
linked into the scan chain after a reset using either TRST
or the JTAG state machine&rsquo;s <small>RESET</small> state.
You may use <code>-enable</code> to highlight the default state
(the TAP is linked in).
See <a href="#enablinganddisablingtaps">Enabling and Disabling TAPs</a>.
</li><li> <code>-expected-id</code> <var>NUMBER</var>
<br>A non-zero <var>number</var> represents a 32-bit IDCODE
which you expect to find when the scan chain is examined.
These codes are not required by all JTAG devices.
<em>Repeat the option</em> as many times as required if more than one
ID code could appear (for example, multiple versions).
Specify <var>number</var> as zero to suppress warnings about IDCODE
values that were found but not included in the list.

<p>Provide this value if at all possible, since it lets OpenOCD
tell when the scan chain it sees isn&rsquo;t right. These values
are provided in vendors&rsquo; chip documentation, usually a technical
reference manual. Sometimes you may need to probe the JTAG
hardware to find these values.
See <a href="#autoprobing">Autoprobing</a>.
</p></li><li> <code>-ignore-version</code>
<br>Specify this to ignore the JTAG version field in the <code>-expected-id</code>
option. When vendors put out multiple versions of a chip, or use the same
JTAG-level ID for several largely-compatible chips, it may be more practical
to ignore the version field than to update config files to handle all of
the various chip IDs. The version field is defined as bit 28-31 of the IDCODE.
</li><li> <code>-ircapture</code> <var>NUMBER</var>
<br>The bit pattern loaded by the TAP into the JTAG shift register
on entry to the <small>IRCAPTURE</small> state, such as 0x01.
JTAG requires the two LSBs of this value to be 01.
By default, <code>-ircapture</code> and <code>-irmask</code> are set
up to verify that two-bit value. You may provide
additional bits if you know them, or indicate that
a TAP doesn&rsquo;t conform to the JTAG specification.
</li><li> <code>-irmask</code> <var>NUMBER</var>
<br>A mask used with <code>-ircapture</code>
to verify that instruction scans work correctly.
Such scans are not used by OpenOCD except to verify that
there seems to be no problems with JTAG scan chain operations.
</li></ul>

<dd><p>At this writing this TAP attribute
mechanism is used only for event handling.
(It is not a direct analogue of the <code>cget</code>/<code>configure</code>
mechanism for debugger targets.)
See the next section for information about the available events.
</p>
<p>The <code>configure</code> subcommand assigns an event handler,
a TCL string which is evaluated when the event is triggered.
The <code>cget</code> subcommand returns that handler.
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="TAP-Events"></a>
<h3 class="section">10.5 TAP Events</h3>
<a name="index-events-1"></a>
<a name="index-TAP-events"></a>

<p>OpenOCD includes two event mechanisms.
The one presented here applies to all JTAG TAPs.
The other applies to debugger targets,
which are associated with certain TAPs.
</p>
<p>The TAP events currently defined are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>post-reset</b>
<br> The TAP has just completed a JTAG reset.
The tap may still be in the JTAG <small>RESET</small> state.
Handlers for these events might perform initialization sequences
such as issuing TCK cycles, TMS sequences to ensure
exit from the ARM SWD mode, and more.

<p>Because the scan chain has not yet been verified, handlers for these events
<em>should not issue commands which scan the JTAG IR or DR registers</em>
of any particular target.
<b>NOTE:</b> As this is written (September 2009), nothing prevents such access.
</p></li><li> <b>setup</b>
<br> The scan chain has been reset and verified.
This handler may enable TAPs as needed.
</li><li> <b>tap-disable</b>
<br> The TAP needs to be disabled. This handler should
implement <code>jtag tapdisable</code>
by issuing the relevant JTAG commands.
</li><li> <b>tap-enable</b>
<br> The TAP needs to be enabled. This handler should
implement <code>jtag tapenable</code>
by issuing the relevant JTAG commands.
</li></ul>

<p>If you need some action after each JTAG reset which isn&rsquo;t actually
specific to any TAP (since you can&rsquo;t yet trust the scan chain&rsquo;s
contents to be accurate), you might:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">jtag configure CHIP.jrc -event post-reset {
  echo &quot;JTAG Reset done&quot;
  ... non-scan jtag operations to be done after reset
}
</pre></div>


<a name="enablinganddisablingtaps"></a><a name="Enabling-and-Disabling-TAPs"></a>
<h3 class="section">10.6 Enabling and Disabling TAPs</h3>
<a name="index-JTAG-Route-Controller"></a>
<a name="index-jrc"></a>

<p>In some systems, a <em>JTAG Route Controller</em> (JRC)
is used to enable and/or disable specific JTAG TAPs.
Many ARM-based chips from Texas Instruments include
an &ldquo;ICEPick&rdquo; module, which is a JRC.
Such chips include DaVinci and OMAP3 processors.
</p>
<p>A given TAP may not be visible until the JRC has been
told to link it into the scan chain; and if the JRC
has been told to unlink that TAP, it will no longer
be visible.
Such routers address problems that JTAG &ldquo;bypass mode&rdquo;
ignores, such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The scan chain can only go as fast as its slowest TAP.
</li><li> Having many TAPs slows instruction scans, since all
TAPs receive new instructions.
</li><li> TAPs in the scan chain must be powered up, which wastes
power and prevents debugging some power management mechanisms.
</li></ul>

<p>The IEEE 1149.1 JTAG standard has no concept of a &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; tap,
as implied by the existence of JTAG routers.
However, the upcoming IEEE 1149.7 framework (layered on top of JTAG)
does include a kind of JTAG router functionality.
</p>

<p>In OpenOCD, tap enabling/disabling is invoked by the Tcl commands
shown below, and is implemented using TAP event handlers.
So for example, when defining a TAP for a CPU connected to
a JTAG router, your <samp>target.cfg</samp> file
should define TAP event handlers using
code that looks something like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">jtag configure CHIP.cpu -event tap-enable {
  ... jtag operations using CHIP.jrc
}
jtag configure CHIP.cpu -event tap-disable {
  ... jtag operations using CHIP.jrc
}
</pre></div>

<p>Then you might want that CPU&rsquo;s TAP enabled almost all the time:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">jtag configure $CHIP.jrc -event setup &quot;jtag tapenable $CHIP.cpu&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>Note how that particular setup event handler declaration
uses quotes to evaluate <code>$CHIP</code> when the event is configured.
Using brackets { } would cause it to be evaluated later,
at runtime, when it might have a different value.
</p>

<a name="autoprobing"></a><a name="Autoprobing"></a>
<h3 class="section">10.7 Autoprobing</h3>
<a name="index-autoprobe"></a>
<a name="index-JTAG-autoprobe"></a>

<p>TAP configuration is the first thing that needs to be done
after interface and reset configuration. Sometimes it&rsquo;s
hard finding out what TAPs exist, or how they are identified.
Vendor documentation is not always easy to find and use.
</p>
<p>To help you get past such problems, OpenOCD has a limited
<em>autoprobing</em> ability to look at the scan chain, doing
a <em>blind interrogation</em> and then reporting the TAPs it finds.
To use this mechanism, start the OpenOCD server with only data
that configures your JTAG interface, and arranges to come up
with a slow clock (many devices don&rsquo;t support fast JTAG clocks
right when they come out of reset).
</p>
<p>For example, your <samp>openocd.cfg</samp> file might have:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">source [find interface/olimex-arm-usb-tiny-h.cfg]
reset_config trst_and_srst
jtag_rclk 8
</pre></div>

<p>When you start the server without any TAPs configured, it will
attempt to autoconfigure the TAPs. There are two parts to this:
</p>
<ol>
<li> <em>TAP discovery</em> ...
After a JTAG reset (sometimes a system reset may be needed too),
each TAP&rsquo;s data registers will hold the contents of either the
IDCODE or BYPASS register.
If JTAG communication is working, OpenOCD will see each TAP,
and report what <samp>-expected-id</samp> to use with it.
</li><li> <em>IR Length discovery</em> ...
Unfortunately JTAG does not provide a reliable way to find out
the value of the <samp>-irlen</samp> parameter to use with a TAP
that is discovered.
If OpenOCD can discover the length of a TAP&rsquo;s instruction
register, it will report it.
Otherwise you may need to consult vendor documentation, such
as chip data sheets or BSDL files.
</li></ol>

<p>In many cases your board will have a simple scan chain with just
a single device. Here&rsquo;s what OpenOCD reported with one board
that&rsquo;s a bit more complex:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">clock speed 8 kHz
There are no enabled taps. AUTO PROBING MIGHT NOT WORK!!
AUTO auto0.tap - use &quot;jtag newtap auto0 tap -expected-id 0x2b900f0f ...&quot;
AUTO auto1.tap - use &quot;jtag newtap auto1 tap -expected-id 0x07926001 ...&quot;
AUTO auto2.tap - use &quot;jtag newtap auto2 tap -expected-id 0x0b73b02f ...&quot;
AUTO auto0.tap - use &quot;... -irlen 4&quot;
AUTO auto1.tap - use &quot;... -irlen 4&quot;
AUTO auto2.tap - use &quot;... -irlen 6&quot;
no gdb ports allocated as no target has been specified
</pre></div>

<p>Given that information, you should be able to either find some existing
config files to use, or create your own. If you create your own, you
would configure from the bottom up: first a <samp>target.cfg</samp> file
with these TAPs, any targets associated with them, and any on-chip
resources; then a <samp>board.cfg</samp> with off-chip resources, clocking,
and so forth.
